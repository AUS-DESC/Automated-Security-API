<h1>Installing the API to a Local Machine</h1>
<ol>
    <li>
        <h3>Initial Installation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure you are installing on a Kali Linux Machine.</li>
            <li>Download the zip file or clone directly to your preferred directory.</li>
            <li>Make sure there is internet connection on the Kali Machine at all times.</li>
            <li>After downloading, go to the downloaded directory (i.e., inside the new downloaded directory.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have <em>extensions.txt, fasttrack.txt, metasploit, pswds.lst, url.txt and user.txt</em>
                in the downloaded directory.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Pre-run Configurations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Inside the API directory, open a terminal and enter <strong><em>npm install</em></strong>. This will
                install all node dependencies required.</li>
            <li><strong>DO NOT MODIFY THE <em>.env</em> FILE </strong> with any of your own paths.</li>
            <li>Any of the <em>passwordlists and extension files</em> inside the API can be modified to reflect what you
                want. However it is <strong>recommended to not do so</strong>
                because they already contain good estimates of what is required.</li>
            <li>Finally, inside the API in a terminal, enter <strong>node pentestApi.js</strong> and hit enter.</li>
            <li>Make sure the console output says <em>Server has started</em>, this means that The API has now started,
                and is waiting for connections.</li>
            <li><strong>NOTE:</strong> The API runs on port 3005, and normally you shouldn't have anything running on
                this port. If you do get an error, make sure that
                there is no process running on port 3005 and kill such a process!</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Sending Requests to the API</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A request can be sent from anywhere in the form of an HTTP request, i.e., from inside code, from a
                platform or simply from a terminal in the form of
                <strong>http://hostaddress:port/starttest/192.168.1/startIP/endIP/phases</strong>.</li>
            <li>A sample request looks like the following - <br> <strong>curl
                    http://localhost:3005/starttest/192.168.1/212/212/ivd</strong> <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        In this example we used the curl command to send a request to a RESTful HTTP route. We used
                        <em>localhost</em> because we sent the request from the
                        same machine, in other cases acquire the IP Address of the Kali Machine and send a request to
                        that IP, followed by the port.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The route parameters include the <em>startest</em> keyword followed by the local subnet which is
                        <em>192.168.1</em> in most cases.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This is followed by a start IP address, in this case start from 192.168.1.212. The next
                        parameter is the end IP Address. In this case its the same
                        device. This means it only pen-tests one device. <br>
                        The last parameter is to specify the phases of testing, which for now need to include all 3
                        phases, <br>
                        i -> Information Gathering <br>
                        v -> Vulnerabililty Assessment <br>
                        d -> Dictionary Attacks
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
